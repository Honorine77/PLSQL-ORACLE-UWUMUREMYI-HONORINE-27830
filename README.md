# REPORT
The assignment was about oracle-sql developer installation.
# Task 1:
 I created a new Pluggable Database (PDB) using the format FirstTwoLettersOfFirstName_pdb_StudentID.

# Task 2:
 I created and deleted another PDB named FirstTwoLettersOfName_to_delete_pdb_StudentID.

# Task 3:
 This task was challanging and we were told to take time and access how to do it correctly later.
# Challanges
During this assignment, I encounted installation issues multiple times with oracle 21c, in the start the process was going well but at the last step some of the files failed to be installed.
To solve this issue, I opted for oracle 23ai and it worked seemlessly.
